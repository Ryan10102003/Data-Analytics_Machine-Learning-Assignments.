        "1. What is a parameter?\n",
        " - A parameter is a variable used by a model to make predictions, learned from the training data (e.g., weights in linear regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        " - Correlation measures the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        " - Machine learning is a field of AI where systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        " - A lower loss value indicates the model’s predictions are closer to the actual values, meaning the model is performing well.\n",
        "A high loss means poor prediction accuracy and the model needs improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        " - Continuous variables can take any numerical value within a range (e.g., height, weight).\n",
        "Categorical variables represent distinct groups or categories (e.g., gender, color).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        " - We handle categorical variables by converting them into numerical form.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        " - Training a dataset means using data to teach the model patterns.\n",
        "Testing a dataset means evaluating the model’s performance on unseen data.\n",

        "\n",
        "8. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        " - `sklearn.preprocessing` is a module in Scikit-learn used for scaling, transforming, and encoding data before feeding it into a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a Test set?\n",
        " - A test set is a portion of data used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data after training.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        " - We split data using functions like `train_test_split` from Scikit-learn.\n",
        "Approach: understand problem, collect data, preprocess, choose model, train, evaluate, and tune.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        " - EDA helps understand data patterns, detect outliers, and find relationships, improving model accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is correlation?\n",
        " - Correlation shows how strongly two variables are related and their direction (positive or negative).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        " - Negative correlation means when one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        " - Use `df.corr()` in pandas to find correlation between variables in Python.\n",

        "\n",
        "15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example?\n",
        " - Causation means one event directly causes another.\n",
        "Correlation shows a relationship but doesn’t prove cause; e.g., ice cream sales and drowning incidents correlate but ice cream doesn’t cause drowning.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example?\n",
